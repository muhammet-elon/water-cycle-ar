WATER CYCLE AR — GitHub Pages Quick Launch

This folder is ready to upload to a GitHub repo and publish with GitHub Pages.
It includes:
- index.html
- Water_Cycle.usdz

STEP-BY-STEP (GitHub)
1) Create a new GitHub repository (public), e.g. "water-cycle-ar".
2) Upload BOTH files from this folder to the repo root:
   - index.html
   - Water_Cycle.usdz
3) Enable GitHub Pages:
   Repo → Settings → Pages
   - Source: Deploy from a branch
   - Branch: main
   - Folder: / (root)
   Save.
4) Find the published URL on the same Pages settings screen:
   https://USERNAME.github.io/REPO/
5) Open that URL on your iPhone in Safari (or scan a QR code pointing to it).
6) Tap “View in AR (iPhone/iPad)”.

ANDROID
To support Android too, you typically need to host a .glb file and use <model-viewer> or an Android intent link.
